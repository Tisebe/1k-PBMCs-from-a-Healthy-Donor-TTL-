 This reproducible R Markdown analysis was created with workflowr (version 1.4.0). The Checks tab describes the reproducibility checks that were applied when the results were created. The Past versions tab lists the development history.  This vignette demonstrates how to manipulate bus format in R with BUSpaRse. The most recent version of bustools can generate gene count matrices from bus files more efficiently; the purpose of the separate implementation in BUSpaRse is for advanced users to experiment with new ways to collapse UMIs mapped to multiple genes and to adapt bus format to purposes other than single cell RNA-seq. This implementation is intended to facilitate exploration using R/Rcpp, which is easier to work with than C++.
